# Use Cases

I can think of at least three use cases for this service:

1. Retrieve achievement level for one user
2. Retrieve achievement levels for all users
3. Retrieve all users of a specific level

Use case 1 covers a scenarios like needing to check or view that one specific user's level. Such as the user
themselves accessing the relevant page.

Use case 2 covers a service needing all users to perform additional functions. Perhaps for something like
metrication.

Use case 3 is similar to case 2, but for situations where a service only needs all users of a particular
level.
