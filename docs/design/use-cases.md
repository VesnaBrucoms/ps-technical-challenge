# Use Cases

I can think of at least three use cases for this service:

1. Retrieve achievement level for one user
2. Retrieve achievement levels for all users
3. Retrieve all users of a specific level

Use case 1 covers a scenarios like needing to check or view that one specific user's level. Such as the end
user themselves accessing the relevant page.

Use case 2 covers another backend service requiring all user levels to perform additional functions. Perhaps
for something like internal metrication or stats for interested end users.

Use case 3 is similar to case 2, but for situations where a service only needs all users of a particular
level. Such as the above example of end user viewable stats.

## Additional Use Cases

If additional use cases come to mind during further implementation then they will be documented here.
